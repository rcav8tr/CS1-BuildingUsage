[h1]Workers Buildings[/h1]
The logic of the game grows a new zoned building when there is enough demand for a building of that zone type and there is empty zone of that type. Because there is already demand, a newly grown zoned building will fill very quickly to near 100 percent usage.

Even though it is on the Workers tab, Residential Zone usage is the number of households in the building, not the number of workers.  A household may have more than one citizen.

Only Amusement Park and Zoo from Parklife have workers.  City Park and Nature Reserve do not have workers.

Some buildings normally have no workers, but with a mod like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1806759255]Customize It Extended[/url] the building can be made to have workers.

A Nursing Home from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=554232266]Nursing Homes for Senior Citizens[/url] mod has both residents and workers.  Households (i.e. number of rooms) are included in Residential Zone.  Workers are included in Medical.  If both Residential Zone and Medical are selected, Nursing Home buildings are colored according to Medical workers.

[h3]Employment and Unemployment[/h3]
Employment and unemployment data by education level is shown on the bottom of the Workers tab.  The employment data is for selected usage types except Residential Zone.  The unemployment data comes only from residential zones.

Eligible Workers is normally Young Adults plus Adults.  But when the Hadron Collider is built, most Teens become highly educated and join the workforce.  The game does not include teens in its unemployed and eligible data, but this mod includes teens when the Hadron Collider is built. The game does not separate Park district jobs by education level, so this mod puts the jobs in Uneducated.

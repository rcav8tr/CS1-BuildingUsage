[h1]Vehicles Buildings[/h1]
Industrial Trucks have an unlimited number of vehicles allowed, see the description below in Vehicles Buildings for Transportation.

Disaster Response vehicles and helicopters are combined into one vehicle type because they come from the same building.

Postal Vans & Trucks are combined into one vehicle type because they can come from the same building.

Although IT Cluster (i.e. High Tech) office buildings produce goods, such goods are not delivered by vehicle.

[h1]Vehicles Buildings for Transportation[/h1]
All of the transportation buildings listed below generate vehicles.  However, vehicle usage percent cannot be computed because the number of vehicles allowed is unlimited.  The transportation buildings are included so that you can filter on the various buildings and see the vehicles that belong to these buildings.  Each of these buildings is tracked with the number allowed set to 1, which will cause the building to appear 100% used if any vehicles have been generated.

Only transportation vehicles owned by buildings in your city are shown in color.  Transportation vehicles owned by outside connections are not shown in color.

Cargo transportation includes cargo trucks generated by those buildings.
